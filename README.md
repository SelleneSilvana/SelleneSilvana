- 👋 Hi, I’m @SelleneSilvana
- 👀 I’m interested in open world games, survival genres, RPGs, puzzle games, and so many more. I also enjoy writing and worldbuilding in addition to video games.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Unreal Engine 5 for enviornmental design 
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate on things right now as I'm in the learning phase of things and my time is short between my IRL job, launching a business, and learning UE5
- 📫 How to reach me ... Check back later...
